**Important conventions:**
1. The negative durations can be mentally modeled "BC" years. One hours before 01 Jan 0000, it was "-1" years but  365 days and 23h into the current day.
It was decided that the nanoseconds corresponds to the nanoseconds _into_ the current century. In other words,
a duration with centuries = -1 and nanoseconds = 0 is _a greater duration_ (further from zero) than centuries = -1 and nanoseconds = 1.
Duration zero minus one nanosecond returns a century of -1 and a nanosecond set to the number of nanoseconds in one century minus one.
That difference is exactly 1 nanoseconds, where the former duration is "closer to zero" than the latter.
As such, the largest negative duration that can be represented sets the centuries to i16::MAX and its nanoseconds to NANOSECONDS_PER_CENTURY.
2. It was also decided that opposite durations are equal, e.g. -15 minutes == 15 minutes. If the direction of time matters, use the signum function.

## Algorithm
Given the embedded sine functions in the equation to compute the difference between TDB and TAI from the number of TDB seconds
past J2000, one cannot solve the revert the operation analytically. Instead, we iterate until the value no longer changes.

1. Assume that the TAI duration is in fact the TDB seconds from J2000.
2. Offset to J2000 because `Epoch` stores everything in the J1900 but the TDB duration is in J2000.
3. Compute the offset `g` due to the TDB computation with the current value of the TDB seconds (defined in step 1).
4. Subtract that offset to the latest TDB seconds and store this as a new candidate for the true TDB seconds value.
5. Compute the difference between this candidate and the previous one. If the difference is less than one nanosecond, stop iteration.
6. Set the new candidate as the TDB seconds since J2000 and loop until step 5 breaks the loop, or we've done five iterations.
7. At this stage, we have a good approximation of the TDB seconds since J2000.
8. Reverse the algorithm given that approximation: compute the `g` offset, compute the difference between TDB and TAI, add the TT offset (32.184 s), and offset by the difference between J1900 and J2000."""
